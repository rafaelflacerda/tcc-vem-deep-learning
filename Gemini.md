When you are asked to generate a commit message, generate a Conventional Commit message based on what we have currently in git staged files/staged area:

- The commit header (title) must summarize the main change in 100 characters or fewer.
- Consider only what is already in staged area.
- In the commit body, include a bullet list (maximum 3 bullets) describing other significant changes that are not already mentioned in the header.
- Do not repeat or rephrase the header in the bullet list. Only include additional details not covered by the header.
- The descriptions should reflect the business domain.
- Use our current branch
- This is a C++ application, so just look at .hpp and .cpp files to understand the changes. Ignore all other files since they are related to building the project.
- When specifc files are mentioned in the prompt, only verify those files.
